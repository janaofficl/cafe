    <h1>Welcome to Joe's cafe</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>This job is an alternative to full-time employment and requires fewer work hours per week. A lighter workload may allow for more scheduling flexibility, which is one of many potential benefits. If you are considering applying for or accepting a part-time job, it can help to think through the helpful aspects of part-time employment when making your decision. In this article, we discuss what part-time jobs are and the benefits of part-time jobs. OurEmployers usually pay part-time employees on an hourly, not salaried basis. This hourly pay means that a part-time employee often has the option to increase their workload by agreeing to work additional shifts to cover for other employees during illness or time off. Part-time employees may work more often during busy seasons, such as the weeks leading up to a new school year or the winter holidays. Part-time employees may also work during nights, weekends.</p>
